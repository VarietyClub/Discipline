# The Discipline of Communication

*Camera straight on*
I am going to share what I have learned about the discipline of communication, so that you can make your ideas, your memes, spread beyond your personal network.  

A little over a year ago, I started my weekend morning in my usual way, exploring the depths of YouTube.

When I happened to come across a video put out by this guy, Jeffery Smith who runs an organization called ["The Institute for Responsible Technology"](http://responsibletechnology.org/) which considers itself to be "The most comprehensive source of GMO health information on the web."

*POV of me clicking on the video, screen shot of the Institute for Responsible Technology website, watch the first few seconds where he says he doesn't normally talk strategy*

I don't ordinarily watch many of these videos but the title of this particular one was "What Now? After the DARK Act (H.R. 1599)" which caught my attention because it was going to tell me what their plan was to spread more fear of GMO's.

*Talking to camera shot*

In my day job, I work for an agriculture company called Monsanto; where I am the Director of Millennial Engagement. I am responsible for helping the company figure out where we should be going to address people's concerns about the value and safety of modern farming techniques.  In order to truly understand the questions and concerns people have, I spent a great deal of time learning about all of the individual nodes who have perspectives on biotechnology, pesticides, agrinomics; and so I am relatively familiar with Jefferey Smith's view that GMOs are unproven, dangerous and something he is personally invested in stopping their cultivation.

So I watched the video to hear how he was planning to move forward.

*Change which camera I look into*

What we are about to watch changed me, and it may change you.

*Talking straight to camera*

This is really dark.  Certainly mom's generically are targeted by many if not most companies and organizations trying to raise money; but this is calling out the most vulnerable to fear, the ones confronting major challenges in their lives, those searching for answers; and turning their fear into victories for the campaign to stop the cultivation of GMOs.

*Flash a map of my travel*

Having traveled around the country over the last few years, and been confronted by people who truly believe that my company has evil intentions, I knew the fear was out there, and I understood generally how it was being spread, but I did not understand the true core of their strategy was so calculated and cold.

*Change camera angles*

After watching this video I realized that there are people willing to do whatever it takes to spread their ideologies or sell their products.

*Flash photos of anti-vaccines, Jim Carrey in his funny hat, and other pseudoscience campaigns*

These people may seem aloof because their reasoning is so far away from science and evidence, but they are not.  These are sophisticated people and they aren't just in agriculture and food.  They are everywhere that the science is complex and the general public's misunderstanding can be exploited.

I don't want to live in a world where our decisions are driven by fear; and so if I am going to change that, I need to commit what I have to outcompeting people and organizations.

What I have, that I can commit to sharing with you, is the discipline of communication.

This project, helping you hone your ability to communicate, isn't going to be about my day job.  I will likely draw examples from my work because it is the well I have to draw from, but what I will share here will be applicable to anyone that wants to make their ideas outcompete pseudo-science and fear.

*Flash lists of topics; How to start a presentation so people will listen, How to build your network online, How to handle aggressive questions?*

Starting off, I will put together some concepts that I think are foundational to effectively communicating; but I will be looking for your input- what skills should we discuss to better compete with fear and pseudo-science.

*show video of Tim Williamson, Julie Kelley, Mary & Larry, James & Myles, Science Moms*

I will be asking others to contribute their skills to teach you how to communicate.

*Outside walking with camera on Delmar Loop*

Everyone communicates, and most people are pretty functional at getting their point across. But if you are trying to make your memes out-compete everyone else's so that people learn what you know, that requires discipline, and that is just what we will be getting here.
